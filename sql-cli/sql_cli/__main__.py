    Run a DAG locally. This task assumes that there is a local airflow DB (can be a SQLite file), that has been
    initialized with Airflow tables. Users can also add paths to a connections or variable yaml file which will override
    existing connections for the test run.

    Example of a connections.yaml file:

    ```
    my_sqlite_conn:
        conn_id: my_sqlite_conn
        conn_type: sqlite
        host: ...
    my_postgres_conn:

        conn_type: postgres
        ...
    ```

    :param subdir: the subdirectory or filepath for the DAG. The more precise this is the faster the local runner
    will run as we won't need to parse as many DAGs
    :param conn_file_path: path to connections yaml or json file
    :param variable_file_path: path to variables yaml or json file
